# How to apply Diep.io themes

1. Press the `Home` button in your keyboard to open the in-game console.
    - Depending on your keyboard, that key could be represented as an **arrow pointing to the top-left** or just with the `Home` text. It could also be found using `NUMPAD 7` (with num lock disabled).
    - Do not do this with `F12`/`Ctrl+Shift+I`, this opens the DevTools console and that's not the right one!
2. Paste the code that you just found.
    - Make sure you trust the source and/or authors! If you have doubts then **never paste** the code!
3. Press Enter to execute.
4. Press Home again to close.
5. Enjoy!

## Remember:

- This doesn't automatically load at refresh, you must paste the code again.
- Reload `F5`/`Ctrl+R` to get rid of the theme and restore the default one.
