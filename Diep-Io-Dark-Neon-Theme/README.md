# Diep.io Dark Neon Theme

A black theme for diep.io!

## How to apply diep.io themes

1. Press the `Home` button in your keyboard to open the in-game console.
    - Depending on your keyboard, that key could be represented as an **arrow pointing to the top-left** or just with the `Home` text. It could also be found using `NUMPAD 7` with num lock disabled.
    - Warning: Don't do this with `F12`/`Ctrl + Shift + I`, this opens the browser's developer tools console and that's not the right one!
2. Paste the code from the JS file.
    - Make sure you trust the source and/or authors! If you have doubts then stay safe and **never paste** the code!
3. Press Enter to execute the code and apply the theme.
4. Press `Home` again to close the console.
5. Enjoy!

## Remember:

- This doesn't automatically load at refresh, you must paste the code again.
- Reload using `F5`/`Ctrl + R` to get rid of the theme and restore the default one.
