# Custom Font Everywhere

With this style you can make your favorite fonts to appear in every website you visit! Plus, it tries not to break icon fonts. It isn't 100% accurate, but you can contribute by reporting broken icons or making a pull request!

To set your fonts you need to edit the following variables: `--customFont` and `--monoCustomFont` then simply put the font names you'd like to use. You can put multiple fonts by separating them with a comma, the first one will be used if possible. If a font doesn't work, the next one will be used.

The `--customFont` variable is used for most texts, and `--monoCustomFont` is used for elements using a monospace font `like this`.

There is also a space where you can put the font names without enabling them, no need to create a separate notes space!
